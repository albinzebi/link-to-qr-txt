# Link to qr code image and txt file
NodeJS project that asks user for a link and creates a qr code image and a text file with the link inside.

I installed **inquirer** and **qr-image** packages to implement the part that gets user input and creates the qr code image.
I used the **fs** module to write the user input to a text file.
